# This is a FullStack project using ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB - ZipRecruiter clone

- There are 2 separate directories for the frontend and backend. Both are in root directory.
- To run the project, you need to run both the frontend and backend servers. To run Frontend server, go to frontend  directory and run `npm start`. To run Backend server, go to backend directory and run `npm start`.

- The frontend server runs on port 3000 and backend server runs on port 5000. The backend server is configured to run on port 4100. If you want to change the port, you can change it in backend/server.js file.

- The backend server uses ES6 module syntax. Thus the file extension is .mjs instead of .js. If you want to change it to .js, you need to change the import and export statements in the backend files.
